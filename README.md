# STM32F042F6P6-PMW3360DM_HID-Mouse

This is my ACFUN Home page: https://www.acfun.cn/u/7503062
 
it can be work, but one thing that i don't know why!
	
the mouse speed is too low, i really hope somebody can tell me why!
the thing is : 
same speed = Intellimouse_3.0 400DPI 125Hz = Atmega32u4 PMW3360 800DPI 1000Hz =STM32F042 PMW3360 1600DPI 1000Hz.
