> software: keil 5
> hardware: 
1. MCU: stm32f042
2. Sensor: pmww3360-dM
3. five buttons with hardware debounce
4. Encoder

This is my ACFUN Home page: https://www.acfun.cn/u/7503062

it can be work, but one thing that i don't know why!
the mouse speed is too low, i really hope somebody can tell me why!

the thing is : 
same speed = Intellimouse_3.0 400DPI 125Hz = Atmega32u4 PMW3360 800DPI 1000Hz =STM32F042 PMW3360 1600DPI 1000Hz.
